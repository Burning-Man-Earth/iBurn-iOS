She's sitting sitting like a lion or dog atop a large red boulder with her tail winding over two more.  She's made of smooth cool concrete to give a feeling of solidity and endurance.\n\nAkle' represents the guardian nature of dragons, that of spiritual beings watching over us.  Akle' was born as a tribute to the artist's dog Elka who past away during the construction of this project.",

    "description": "Emerging from the study of geometry in sacred architecture, this artwork has been inspired by the dendritic forms of medieval vaulting. Medieval architects used the arched geometry of ribs and vaulted ceilings to achieve a soaring lightness and elevate the spirit; the architecture had a spiritual function. We have digitized these geometries and manipulated them in parametric models to design a contemporary structure that achieves the same objective.\nThe Arbour celebrates life through geometry, which underlies the structure of so many life-forms. The Arbour's soaring ribs draw our gaze heavenwards and inspire us to reach for the stars.",
