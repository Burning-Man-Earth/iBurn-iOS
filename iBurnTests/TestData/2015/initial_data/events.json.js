It reminded them of home.\r\n\r\nSoul Brunch isn't just a party; it's like the backyard barbecues of home. It's like the cookouts of yesteryear. As your families invited your communities over, as the generations of soul families invited their communities over, so too does the Heroes & Super Villains family invite the Playa community over to eat together, drink together, get to know one another, dance with each other and uplift each other.\r\n\r\nFrom morning until nightfall, our trained chefs serve up the freshest breakfast burritos on the Playa, accompanied by professionally made craft cocktails. Our collection of international DJs spin smooth beats until nightfall.\r\n\r\nWe also give revelers a chance to clean up with our Soul Power Showers; guests experience the rebirth and rejuvenation of cool, cleansing water sprayed forcefully from our pressurized washer system (imagine a water saving car wash inside our shower areas for guests). Baptized anew, heroes set out on their way spreading positive vibes.\r\n\r\nDJ Lineup:\r\n-Marques Wyatt\r\n-Nicodemus\r\n-Deep Woods\r\n-Sabo\r\n-Rafael de la Cruz",
