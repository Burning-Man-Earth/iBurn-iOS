Or participate in the Battle of Words hip hop and spoken word slam down. Come early if you have special tech requests. On Playa collaborations and works in progress encouraged. Bear Margaritas for all!!\r\n\r\nThe Salon is a night of creative expression. Our community started hosting salons in January 2010 as a safe space for the folks of Synchronicity and our friends to share finished or unfinished works of art, poetry, song, or any form of creative release.  The idea was to encourage people in the community to create, share, and hear thoughts or ideas from fellow creative souls.  It has since expanded, and we have enjoyed works of musicians, poets, storytellers, palindromists, historians, novelists, ramblers, gamblers, painters, filmmakers, drunks, fathers, mothers, lovers, dreamers, and psychedelic clowns from all over this land!\r\nA crowd of lovely folks from across the playa will be gathering at 7.30 pm in preparation for the night's event.  A list will be roaming around, with 20 spots to fill. As 8 pm nears, we pile in front of our stage and are greeted by the lovely host of the evening.  From there.. anything goes!",
