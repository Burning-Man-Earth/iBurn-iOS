# [iBurn-iOS](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-iOS)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-iOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-iOS)

iBurn is an offline map and guide for the [Burning Man](http://www.burningman.com) art festival. For the 2014 release it has been rewritten from scratch for iOS 7 on top of some really awesome open source software. We decided to use [YapDatabase](https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase)+[Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle) instead of Core Data, and [Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk) instead of MapKit for our [offline map tiles](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-Maps). For a more complete list check out our `Podfile`. For users of Android devices, we also develop a version of [iBurn for Android](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-Android).

## Installation

* Install [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) and the most recent version of Xcode.
* `$ git submodule update --init`
* `$ pod install`
* open `iBurn.xcworkspace` (**not** the .xcodeproj file!)
* Create `BRCSecrets.m` and fill it with the following contents:

	```obj-c
	NSString * const kBRCHockeyBetaIdentifier = @"";
	NSString * const kBRCHockeyLiveIdentifier = @"";

* Compile and Run!

**Note**: Camp, Art and Event location data (`camps.json`, `art.json`, `events.json`) are embargoed by BMorg until the gates open each year. There isn't anything we can do about this until BMorg changes their policy. Sorry!

Fortunately, you can still run and test the app with the previous year's data.

## TODO

* load `image_url` for art when internet is available
* Open in Safari pop up when clicking links
* Add UILocationNotification on favoriting event
* Add filtering for event types and date proximity (work in progress...)
* Onboarding
* About page / attributions
* Show data from previous years
* Retina mbtiles support
* Optimizations
* Data Embargo :(
