# [iBurn-iOS](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-iOS)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-iOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-iOS)

iBurn is an offline map and guide for the [Burning Man](http://www.burningman.com) art festival. For the 2014 release it has been rewritten from scratch for iOS 7 on top of some really awesome open source software. We decided to use [YapDatabase](https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase)+[Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle) instead of Core Data, and [Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk) instead of MapKit for our [offline map tiles](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-Maps). For a more complete list check out our `Podfile`. For users of Android devices, we also develop a version of [iBurn for Android](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-Android).

## Installation

* Install [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) and the most recent version of Xcode.
* `$ git submodule update --init`
* `$ pod install`
* open `iBurn.xcworkspace` (**not** the .xcodeproj file!)
* Create `BRCSecrets.m` and fill it with the following contents:

	```obj-c
	NSString * const kBRCHockeyBetaIdentifier = @"";
	NSString * const kBRCHockeyLiveIdentifier = @"";
	// To generate new passcode (without salt):
	// $ echo -n passcode | sha256sum
	NSString * const kBRCEmbargoPasscodeSHA256Hash = @"";
	```

* Compile and Run!

**Note**: Camp, Art and Event location data (`camps.json`, `art.json`, `events.json`) are embargoed by BMorg until the gates open each year. There isn't anything we can do about this until BMorg changes their policy. Sorry!

Fortunately, you can still run and test the app with the previous year's data.

## TODO

* load `image_url` for art when internet is available
* Open in Safari pop up when clicking links
* Onboarding
* Show data from previous years
* Optimizations (only load 1 day of events at a time) 
* Scroll back to top when switching sort
* Search symbols (.,&,?,...)
* Use fancy animations instead of `reloadData` everywhere
* Show data type for amiguous cells (art, camps) when searching on map
* Refactor BRCMapViewController and BRCFilteredTableViewController and pull out the common code used for full-text search, and swipe-to-favorite cells.
* Rewrite FTS search to use YapDatabaseSearchResultsView
* Show favorites on map after yapdb view loading is complete instead of waiting until retry on viewWillAppear
* Refactor BRCMapViewController so annotation-loading code is shared between data types
* Add ability for user to add their own notes to camps, art, events
