For 2013 several of them will return and be clustered together in the deep Playa at 11:11, including the 11:11 Diamond Portal Outline, 12:21 Turquoise Portal, 1:11 Sapphire Portal Center and possibly the 12:12 Emerald Portal and 2:22 Amethyst Portal, if enough funds are generated and people involved. The Portals are evolutionary interfaces that can reawaken our sacred connection to the mystery of life by aligning participant's multi-dimensional vibrational energy body to the evolution of the Earth's energy body through the use of sacred geometry, color and sound. They are activated by the vibrations of the Quasar Wave Transducer housed within them: a low frequency non linear dynamic feedback device that sounds like a big cat purring. They have been installed at many festivals throughout the world besides Burning Man.",

        "description": "Humans have launched about 24,000 man made objects into orbit, many of them still out there, sometimes falling into orbit, sometimes colliding with other objects creating a cascading effect of refuse which is known as ablation cascade. As the trash orbits earth, we imagine our planet growing rings like Saturn, gradually filling out further into space. This reminds us of a more optimistic and bygone astronomical tool, the spherical astrolabe or armillary sphere. Since Hellenistic times, astrolabes were used to show the location of celestial bodies around the earth. Rings commonly represented the equator, the ecliptic, meridians and parallel. Our astrolabe we will use recycled and found objects to curate each orbiting ring into a sphere of beautiful refuse.  Our goal is to create an interactive astrolabe that's pleasing to the eye, ear and touch. You are invited to explore the lights, colors and sounds generated by your space discovery.",

The event organizers had very few restrictions on the final outcome of the project other than it had to be large scale and affect the horizon. Having few restrictions, we chose to create not just an installation, but rather a symbol with a purpose. We also wanted it to live on past the event so we designed it to be \u201creusable\u201d so that it can be assembled anywhere. The result of our collective efforts is \"Ascension\" affectionately known as Coco, a 150\u2019 origami crane (with roughly the same wing span of a Boeing 747).",

This modern day igloo is built in a desert rather than a snowstorm, made from castaway defunct objects-old CD's.  The ultra reflective quality of the CD's bounce the suns rays off the igloo, creating a beacon in the desert, and helping to keep the shelter cool, a reversal of the igloo's original snow shelter purpose.

The two primary themes are money (federal and corporate powerhouse) and music (local DC musical heritage) representing two sides of the DC Cultural spectrum. The design is based on the Eye of the Pyramid (Great Seal) and generally reflects the occult geometric concepts used to design the District of Columbia. The pyramid structure is ancient and remains a mystery; it exists on the singular most significant demonic symbol of our time (money), which is virtually non-existent in BRC and antithetical to the Cargo Cult mythos. On the inside, the theme showcases the \u201clocal DC\u201d in the form of music that was created over time by artists associated with DC: John Phillip Sousa, Chuck Brown, Mark Robinson, Duke Ellington, Roberta Flack, Dave Grohl, Thievery Corporation, etc.",

Grass huts were the earliest human buildings. They could be rolled up and taken with the family group as they moved from place to place. They often approximated a Fibonacci sequence, a spiral found abundantly in nature, from the pattern of seeds in a sunflower to the cloud formation of a hurricane. First House is a structure built into that spiral, which climbs higher and higher, to a column that points skyward, creating a guidepost for our own navigation and suggesting that others might find it (and us). It is a dance, marking our passage and invoking connections to the hoped for, the unseen. And, as is our very nature, it is temporary - here for a week, then gone in a moment of heat and smoke.",

Our two serpents render in metal and cast off materials these mythical beasts by using modern science; restoring ancient mythos to the Burning Man community\n The Serpent Twins by Jon Sarriugarte, Kyrsten Mate Oakland, CA The Serpent Twins: The Jormungand (Midgard) and Julunggul (Rainbow) serpents sit between two worlds; the old world which needed and revered them and the present which has shunned such monsters as fears metamorphosed into mythical form. Our present world has left behind these harbingers of destruction and physical embodiments of \u201cthe ultimate task\u201d (usually the task of slaying such beasts) as so much fantasy. Much as a child puts away his imaginary playthings when he becomes an adult, the dreadful serpent that exists in so many of the world\u2019s cultures\u2019s myths has been put aside. All these now modern civilizations went through this same rite of passage; that of dismissing myth and legend to depend merely on science and fact. Our two serpents render in metal and cast off materials these mythical beasts by using modern science; restoring ancient mythos to the Burning Man community",

Six people power the Shamancycle via peddling, 1 person steers, and the steering mechanism is integrated with the massive eagle structure on top, so when the bike turns the head and wings move in perfect unison! The Shamancycle is made from reclaimed and repurposed metal parts, imagineered by artist Phoebe Legere and engineered by a rocket scientist named Jeff Curious. The Shamancycle will have a pedal powered generator to make it a truly off the grid mode of transportation.  Oh, and fireballs shoot out of it's eyes, because that is awesome.At Burning Man 2013. During the day, the ShamanCycle will be parked out front of ShamanDome, and at night we will glide over the landscape, listening to the spontaneous call for healing, ceremony, and celebration.",

On one end of the installation is an automated video booth that elicits a series of 15 responses over 90 seconds from participants. When finished recording, the video is copied to a mixing station where participants can easily select their videos and play them back while synthesizing the sound, video, and background art in real time, via a very simplified custom controller that consists of multiple illuminated push buttons and slide potentiometers. The videos are constantly projected throughout the night onto a large dual projection screen, and comfortable lounge space is provided for people to relax and enjoy the moving portraits of their fellow playa citizens.",

However, for this art work for Burning Man, there is a cap on the number of people participating due to the specific concept of the work.\nWe are asking for a photograph because we want to have a wide range of body types and skin tonalities represented in the final work. Although everyone is unique, If you are not chosen, it is simply because we may have reached the amount of people with similar specific characteristics. We apologize in advance if you are not chosen for this particular idea but please do not let it deter you from posing in future works by Spencer where there are no number limits.\n\nChosen participants will be contacted by email prior to August 26th with: the day, time, location and further instructions. Please only sign up if you are committed to participating and able to wake up before sunrise (or stay up all night). The work will take place before sunrise in order to utilize the pre-dawn light. You will be in position when the sun rises.\n You only will be nude for a short period of time. In exchange for taking part, you will receive by mail, a limited edition print of the art work you take part in. Thank you for wanting",
